Explanation: 
Our team consists of three members, Pablo from Mexico, Hayoung from Korea, and Sadid from Bangladesh. And we are college students who are interested in technology and especially how it changes society.

Take a guess on how many people in the US are aged between 10 and 18. 41 million. How many of those exercise the right to vote? 0.

We believe that these people deserve a chance to have their voices heard - especially in school where they face a lot of problems. We built an application called Swipo that helps teenagers to express their opinions and turn them into real change in their school. 

When a user signs up by entering their name, email, and school, the first screen asks them about how your week is going. If you swipe right, that means pretty good, and if you swipe left, that is pretty bad. If your week is pretty bad, the app asks you the reason why. The user briefly writes about the problem and submit. Then a message pops up, telling them they are not the only one struggling. The screen starts showing them the problems other students have. If you swiped right in the beginning, you directly comes to this stage without writing your problem. 

For each problem, if you swipe right, you empathize with it, and if you swipe left, you don’t think it’s a problem. If you swipe up, you don’t have enough information about it. At every Friday, the dashboard shows top 3 problems that resonated most with the students. Students can freely discuss about the issues by commenting. And most importantly, there willl be a biweekly townhall meeting with school officials that covers the most pressing issues of the week. The rest of the problems will be included in a detailed weekly report provided to school principals for future reference.
